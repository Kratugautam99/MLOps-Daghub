🔧 Tech Stack
🔹 Python
The core programming language for building and orchestrating all components of your ML workflow—data processing, training scripts, API endpoints, and glue code for tools like DVC and MLflow.

🔹 DVC (Data Version Control)
A Git-like system for versioning datasets, models, and pipeline stages. It helps you reproduce experiments and collaborate without storing large files in the Git repo. It also enables pipelines with dvc.yaml.

🔹 Git
Version control for code and lightweight files. It works in tandem with DVC to manage the code+data+model ecosystem in sync and allows branching, reverting, and tracking changes over time.

🔹 DagsHub
A GitHub-integrated platform that brings Git, DVC, and experiment tracking together. It provides a UI to visualize experiments, compare runs, and store datasets and models. Think of it as a collaborative dashboard tailored for MLOps.

🔹 MLflow
An experiment tracking tool used to log metrics, parameters, artifacts, and models. It lets you compare multiple runs, register models, and optionally serve them through its model registry interface.

🔹 FastAPI
A lightweight, high-performance web framework for building RESTful APIs in Python. In your stack, it can be used to serve trained models via endpoints, making them accessible for predictions in real-time or batch systems.
